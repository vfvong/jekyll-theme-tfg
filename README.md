## Usage

Ease of use is one of the design goals of TFG. Basically, you only need to refer to the [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/vfvong/jekyll-theme-tfg/blob/gh-pages/_config.yml) file of the demo to set the basic parameters required to run the website.

### Customization

You can of course fork the entire repository and make custom changes on your copy, but there is a much cleaner way: after referencing the theme, you just need to copy the [`_sass/tfg/_variables.scss`](https://github.com/vfvong/jekyll-theme-tfg/blob/main/_sass/tfg/_variables.scss) file to your repository in the corresponding path, and then modify some variables, you can customize the color and fonts you like.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `jekyll-theme-tfg.gemspec` accordingly.
